# Kali-Linux-Import-and-Export
How I export Kali Linux, the error I got and fixes.
I simply selected the the Kali Linux in the Oracle Virtual box, hosted in my Dell laptop, file, and export appliance, then boom. There was "aborted" error.

It wouldn't export, the Kali Linux wouldn't run, restart the machine, even restarted the host machine , it wouldn't still work. I updated the virtual box, it was still the same.

What fixed the problem was the virtual box extension. The moment I downloaded it, and reinstalled, boom. Everything got normal and I was able to export the Kali Linux to a flash drive and import it on the HP laptop through the import appliance feature.
